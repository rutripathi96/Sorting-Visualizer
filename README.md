# Sorting-Visualizer
The Sorting Visualizer is a console-based tool that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It visualizes the sorting process step by step, helping users understand how elements are compared, swapped, and eventually sorted. This project is implemented in C++ and uses ANSI escape codes to add color to the console output, making the visualization clearer and more engaging.

#Features
Visual Representation: The array is visualized using symbols (#), with different colors representing comparisons, swaps, and sorted elements.

Multiple Sorting Algorithms:

Insertion Sort
Bubble Sort
